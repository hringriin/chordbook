    \beginchorus
        Walk down that lonesome road
        All by yourself
        Don't turn your head
        Back over your shoulder
        And only stop to rest yourself
        When the silver moon
        Is shining high above the trees
    \endchorus

    \beginverse
        If I had stopped to listen once or twice
        If I had closed my mouth and opened my eyes
        If I had cooled my head and warmed my heart
        I'd not be on this road tonight
    \endverse

    \beginverse*
        Carry on \echo{Carry on}
        Never mind feeling sorry for yourself
        It doesn't save you from your troubled mind
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        Walk down that lonesome road
        All by yourself
        Don't turn your head
        Back over your shoulder
        And only stop to rest yourself
        When the silver moon
        Is shining high above the trees
    \endchorus
