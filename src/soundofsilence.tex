    \beginverse
        Hello darkness, my old firned
        I've come to talk with you again
        Because a vision softly creeping
        Left its seeds while I was sleeping
        And the vision that was planted in my brain
        Still remains
        Within the sound of silence
    \endverse

    \beginverse
        In restless dreams I walked alone
        Narrow streets of cobblestone
        'neath the halo of a street lamp
        I turned my collar to the cold and damp
        When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
        That split the night
        And touched the sound of silence
    \endverse

    \beginverse
        And in the naked light I saw
        Ten thousand people, maybe more
        People talking without speaking
        People hearing without listening
        People writing songs that voices never share
        And no one dared
        Disturb the sound of silence
    \endverse

    \beginverse
        ``Fools'', said I, ``You do not know
        Silence like a cancer grows
        Hear my words that I might teach you
        Take my arms that I might reach you''
        But my words, like silent raindrops fell
        And echoed
        In the wells of silence
    \endverse

    \beginverse
        And the people bowed and prayed
        To the neon god they made
        And the sign flashed out its warning
        In the words that it was forming
        And the sign said, ``The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
        And tenement halls''
        And whispered in the sound of silence
    \endverse
