    \beginverse
        Now you all know
        The bards and their songs
        When hours have gone by
        I'll close my eyes
        In a world far away
        We may meet again
        But now hear my song
        About the dawn of the night
        Let's sing the bards' song
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        Tomorrow will take us away
        Far from home
        No one will ever know our names
        But the bards' songs will remain
        Tomorrow will take it away
        The fear of today
        It will be gone
        Due to our magic songs
    \endchorus

    \beginverse
        There's only one song
        Left in my mind
        Tales of a brave man
        Who lived far from here
        Now the bard songs are over
        And it's time to leave
        No one should ask you for the name
        Of the one
        Who tells the story
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        Tomorrow will take us away
        Far from home
        No one will ever know our names
        But the bards' songs will remain
        Tomorrow all will be known
        And you're not alone
        So don't be afraid
        In the dark and cold
        'Cause the bards' songs will remain
        They all will remain
    \endchorus

    \beginverse*
        In my thoughts and in my dreams
        They're always in my mind
        These songs of hobbits, dwarves and men
        And elves
        Come close your eyes
        You can see them too
    \endverse
