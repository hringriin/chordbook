    \beginverse\memorize[verse]
        Bring me some whiskey, mother
        I'm feeling frisky, mother
        I need a sheep to keep me warm through the night!
        I need a lover, mother
        No, not my brother, mother
        I need a sheep to keep me warm through the night!
    \endverse

    \beginverse\replay[verse]
        Gerbils don't make it, mother
        They just can't take it, mother
        I need a sheep to keep me warm through the night!
        Owls, bats and other critters
        Just tend to give me jitters
        I need a sheep to keep me warm through the night!
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        Sheep never talk about it
        They never ever doubt it
        Always so placid, affectionate and nice!
        Give me that lanolin.
        Better than flannel-in.
        I need a sheep to keep me warm through the night!
    \endchorus
