    \beginverse
        Now I've heard there was a secret chord
        That David played, and it pleased the Lord
        But you dont really care for music, do you?
        It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
        The minor falls, the major lifts
        The baffled king composing Hallelujah
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        Hallelujah, Hallelujah
        Hallelujah, Hallelujah
    \endchorus

    \beginverse
        Your faith was strong but you needed proof
        You saw her bathing on the roof
        Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew her
        She tied you to a kitchen chair
        She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
        And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
    \endverse

    \textnote{Chorus}

    \beginverse
        Baby I have been here before
        I know this room, I've walked this floor
        I use to live alone before I knew you
        I've seen your flag on the marble arch
        Love is not a victory march
        It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
    \endverse

    \textnote{Chorus}

    \beginverse
        There was a time you let me know
        What's really going on below
        But now you never show it to me, do you?
        And remember when I moved in you
        The holy dove was moving too
        And every breath we drew was Hallelujah
    \endverse

    \textnote{Chorus}

    \beginverse
        You say I took the Name in vain
        I dont even know the Name
        But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
        There's a blaze of light in every word
        It doesnt matter which you heard
        The holy or the broken Hallelujah
    \endverse
