Viking Men
Melodie: Jingle Bells


Dashing thru the town, Our firebrands burning bright,
Striking foemen down, Setting things alight,
Swords on axes ring, Making spirits bright,
What fun it is to laugh and sing, A _slaying_ song tonight!

(Chorus )
We're viking men, viking men, plundering your shore,
Another dragon ship sails in discharging twenty more, We're viking men,
viking men, our axes red with gore,
Shouting out our battle cries and singing praise to Thor!
...
See your harbor fair, Filled with our dragon ships,
See men with flame-red hair, And foam on bearded lips,
We come at break of day, To depredate your land,
And then, when we have gone away, No unburnt building stands.
(Chorus- Second line is "Another... discharging forty more.")

We're carrying away, Whatever we admire,
Your forces to delay, We've set the rest on fire.
With you we've had our will, And varied was your cost,
We sacked the convent on the hill, And more than gold was lost!
(Chorus- 2nd line is "Another.... discharging eighty more.")

There is one simple way, To keep us from your shore,
If you'll but Danegeld pay,
(Sung as insincerely as possible) We'll be your _friends_ once more.
his act you will not rue, You'll have no cause to fear,
(Pause a beat or two for effect, the sing loudly...)
Until the next installment's due, When we come back next year!
(Chorus- The 2nd line is now....)
A _fleet_ of dragon ships sail in discharging _thousands_ more!
