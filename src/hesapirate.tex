    \beginverse
        He escaped from the Island our strong Captain Jack,
        He bound turtles together with the hair of his back.
        Left alone with a gun, to look death in the eye,
        But RedBull gave him wings and he learnt how to fly.
    \endverse

    \beginverse
        So he travelled with the guy from the Lord of the Rings
        To the Island of Tortuga where he had a few flings.
        He drafted a crew to find the Isla de Muerta
        With the blood of his bootstrap to get rid of the curse.
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        \lrep Oh, yeah, he is a pirate
        Woh-hoh, king of the seas \rrep \rep{2}

        And the \[Dm]Pearl with its \[C]crew sails the \[F]ocean ton\[C]ight
        And the \[F]darkness re\[C]veals every \[Dm]wound \[Am]can be \[Dm]healed.
        But the \[Dm]moonlight displ\[C]ays what may \[F]hide from your \[Bb]side
        When your \[F]eyes are \[G5]blinded by \[Dm]day\[Am]-\[Dm]light
