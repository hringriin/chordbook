    \beginverse
        In the village of Kildore lived a maiden young and fair
        Her eyes they shone like diamonds, she had long and golden hair
        When the countryman came riding, he came to her daddy's gate
        Mounted on a milkwhite stallion, he came at the stroke of eight
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        Step it out Mary, my fine daughter,
        Step it out Mary, if you can.
        Step it out Mary, my fine daughter,
        Show your legs to the country man,
        Show your legs to the country man.
    \endchorus

    \beginverse
        I've come to court your daughter, Mary of the golden hair
        I have gold and I have silver, I have lands beyond compare
        I will buy her silks and satins and a gold ring for her hand
        I will build for her a mansion, she'll have servants to command
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        Step it out Mary, my fine daughter,
        Step it out Mary, if you can.
        Step it out Mary, my fine daughter,
        Show your legs to the country man,
        Show your legs to the country man.
    \endchorus

    \beginverse
        But kind sir I love a soldier, and I've pledged to him my hand
        I don't want your gold nor silver, I don't want your house nor land
        Mary's father spoke up sharply: you will do as you were told
        You'll marry him on the Sunday and you'll wear the ring of gold
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        Step it out Mary, my fine daughter,
        Step it out Mary, if you can.
        Step it out Mary, my fine daughter,
        Show your legs to the country man,
        Show your legs to the country man.
    \endchorus

    \beginverse
        In the village of Kildore, there's a deep stream running by,
        They found Mary there on Sunday, she had drowned with her soldier boy
        In the cottage there is music, you can hear her daddy say:
        Step it out Mary, my fine daughter, Sunday is your wedding day.
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        So step it out Mary, my fine daughter,
        Step it out Mary, if you can.
        Step it out Mary, my fine daughter,
        Show your legs to the country man,
        Show your legs to the country man.
    \endchorus

    \beginchorus
        Step it out Mary, my fine daughter,
        Step it out Mary, if you can.
        Step it out Mary, my fine daughter,
        Show your legs to the country man,
        Show your legs to the country man.
    \endchorus
