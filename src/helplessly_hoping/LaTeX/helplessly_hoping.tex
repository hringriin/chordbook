    \beginverse
        Helplessly hoping
        Her harlequin hovers nearby
        Awaiting a word
        Gasping at glimpses
        Of gentle true spirit
        He runs, wishing he could fly
        Only to trip at the sound of good-bye
    \endverse

    \beginverse
        Wordlessly watching
        He waits by the window
        And wonders
        At the empty place inside
        Heartlessly helping himself to her bad dreams
        He worries
        Did he hear a good-bye? Or even hello?
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        They are one person
        They are two alone
        They are three together
        They are four for each other
    \endchorus

    \beginverse
        Stand by the stairway
        You'll see something
        Certain to tell you confusion has its cost
        Love isn't lying
        It's loose in a lady who lingers
        Saying she is lost
        And choking on hello
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        They are one person
        They are two alone
        They are three together
        They are four for each other
    \endchorus
