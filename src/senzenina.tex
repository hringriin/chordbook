    \beginverse
        On the road to Guguletu - We have come to walk a mile
        There is sorrow in the township - We know how we donâ€™t why
    \endverse

    \beginverse
        Comrades come in every colour - As the light begins to pale
        There is anger in the township - There is fear and there is shame
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        Senzenina    Senzenina   What have we done what have we done
        Senzenina    Senzenina  There is blood on everyone
    \endchorus

    \beginverse
        On the road to Guguletu - Children fight and women cry
        We pray for justice and for mercy - We won't let her struggle die
    \endverse
