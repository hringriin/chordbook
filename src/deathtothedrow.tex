        \[G]Once we were farmers with no cares at \[C]all
        But our \[G]lives were all \[C]changed when we \[D7]answered the \[G]call.
        To de\[G]fend our homeland with all of our \[C]might
        To \[G]stow any \[C]drow who were \[D7]out for a \[G]fight.

        And she ^picked up a ^sword and said ^she would come ^too

        For ^all of the first week not a drow did we ^slay
        But we ^heard of a ^battle the ^very next ^day
        So we ^all donned our woad and we stepped to the ^fore
        And there's ^three hundred ^dark elves who're ^breathing no ^more

        ^Fled from our lands was the evil in ^black
        So we ^went under^ground to find ^drow to att^ack
        They ^lived in a world full of darkness and ^dread
        But they ^don't live at ^all with an ^axe in their ^head
