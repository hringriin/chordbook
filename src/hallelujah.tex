    \beginverse
        Now I've heard there was a secret chord
        That David played, and it pleased the Lord
        But you dont really care for music, do you?
        It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
        The minor falls, the major lifts
        The baffled king composing Hallelujah
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        Hallelujah, Hallelujah
        Hallelujah, Hallelujah
    \endchorus

    \beginverse
        Your faith was strong but you needed proof
        You saw her bathing on the roof
        Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew her
        She tied you to a kitchen chair
        She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
        And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
    \endverse

    \textnote{Chorus}

    \beginverse
        You say I took the Name in vain
        I dont even know the Name
        But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
        There's a blaze of light in every word
        It doesnt matter which you heard
        The holy or the broken Hallelujah
    \endverse

    \textnote{Chorus}

    \beginverse
        I did my best, but it wasnt much
        I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
        I've told the truth, I didnt come to fool you
        And even though it all went wrong
        I'll stand before the Lord of song
        With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah
    \endverse

    \textnote{Chorus}
