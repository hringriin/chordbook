        In constant sorrow through his days
    \endchorus

    \beginverse
        I am a man of constant sorrow
        I've seen trouble all my day
        I bid farewell to old Kentucky
        The place where I was born and raised
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        The place where he was born and raised
    \endchorus

    \beginverse
        For six long years I've been in trouble
        No pleasures here on earth I found
        For in this world I'm bound to ramble
        I have no friends to help me now
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        He has no friends to help him now
    \endchorus

    \beginverse
        It's fare thee well my old lover
        I never expect to see you again
        For I'm bound to ride that northern railroad
        Perhaps I'll die upon this train
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        Perhaps he'll die upon this train
    \endchorus

    \beginverse
        You can bury me in some deep valley
        For many years where I may lay
        Then you may learn to love another
        While I am sleeping in my grave
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        While he is sleeping in his grave
    \endchorus

    \beginverse
        Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger
        My face you'll never see no more
        But there is one promise that is given
        I'll meet you on God's golden shore
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        He'll meet you on God's golden shorekkkkkk:vsp
