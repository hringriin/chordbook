    \beginverse
        Well \[G]how do you \[Em]do, young \[Am]Willie Mc\[Am/C]Bride,
        Do you \[D7]mind if I sit here down \[G]by your \[C]grave\[G]side
        And \[G]rest for a \[Em]while in the \[Am]warm summer \[Am/C],
        I've been \[D7]working all day and I'm \[G]near-\[D]ly \[G]done?

        I can \[G]see by your gr\[Em]avestone you were \[Am]only nine\[Am/C]teen,
        When you \[D7]joined the great fallen in \[G]nineteen-s\[Dsus4]ix\[D]teen,
        Well, I \[G]hope you died \[Em]well and I \[Am]hope you died \[Am/C]clean,
        Or young \[D7]Willie McBride was it \[G]slow and \[D]ob\[G]scene.

    \beginchorus
        Did they \[D]beat the drum slowly and \[C]play the fife \[G]lowly?
        Did they \[D]sound the death march, as they \[C]lowered you \[G]down?
        And did the \[C]band play the last post and \[D]chorus?
        And did the \[G]pipes play the \[C]floweres of the \[D]Fo\[Dsus2]-\[D]-\[G]rest.
    \endchorus

    \beginverse
        Did you ^leave a wife ^ or a ^sweetheart be^hind?
        In ^some faithful heart is your ^memory ^en^shrined,
        Al^though you died ^back in ^nineteen-six^teen,
        In ^that faithful heart you are for^ever ^nine^teen.

        Or ^are you a ^stranger without ^even a ^name,
        En^closed and forever be^hind a glass ^ frame ^
        In an ^old photo^graph torn and ^battered and ^stained
        And ^fading to yellow in a ^brown lea^ther ^frame.

        Did they \[D]beat the drum slowly and \[C]play the fife \[G]lowly?

    \beginverse
        The ^sun now it sh^ines on the ^green fields of ^France.
        There's a ^warm summer breeze that makes the ^red pup^pies ^dance.
        And ^look how the ^sun shines from ^under the ^tree,
        There's no ^gas, no barbed wire, no ^guns fir^ing ^now.

        But ^here in this ^graveyard it's ^still "No man's ^ Land",
        The ^countless white crosses lay ^mute und the ^sand. ^
        To ^man's blind in^difference to ^his fellow ^man,
        To a ^whole generation that were ^butchered ^and ^damned.

    \beginverse
        Ah, young ^Willie Mc^Bride I can't ^help wonder ^why
        Do ^all those who lay here know ^why they ^did ^die,
        and ^did they be^lieve when they ^answered the ^call,
        Did ^they really believe that this ^war would ^end ^wars?

        Well, the ^sorrow, the ^suffering, the ^glory and the ^pain,
        The ^killing and the dying were ^all done in^ vain ^.
        For young ^Willie Mc^Bride it all ^happened a^gain,
        and ^again, and again, and a^gain, and ^a^gain!
