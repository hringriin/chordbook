    \beginverse
        I'm just a poor man working day by day
        Lost in the struggle, there's a mountain in my way
        So strap your boots on get ready for that first step
        The uphill battle that I ain't even started yet
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        Chance is you'll find me
        Out in the fields
        Pounding my hammer
        Between stone and steel
        Done my fair share of
        MOUNTAIN CLIMBING (Mountain Climbing)
        Whoa! Its troubles I've got 'em
        MOUNTAIN CLIMBING (Mountain Climbing)
        Whoa! It's blues at the bottom
    \endchorus

    \beginverse
        Ain't no map to follow, just follow your own path
        Get close to the edge and there's no turning back
        The wind and the rain gonna push you around
        Hard times try to break you, don't ever let 'em back you down
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        Chance is you'll find me
        Working away in the fields
        Pounding my hammer
        On the stone and steel
        Done my fair share of
        MOUNTAIN CLIMBING (Mountain Climbing)
        Whoa! Its troubles I've got 'em
        MOUNTAIN CLIMBING (Mountain Climbing)
        Whoa! Blues at the bottom
    \endchorus

    \beginverse
        Blood on my hands and there's holes in my jeans
        You scrub all day but you never get them clean
        It's a hard rock bottom, there ain't nothing down there but the blues
        At the top of the mountain you still gotta pay your dues
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        Chance is you'll find me
        Out in the fields
        Pounding my hammer
        On the stone and steel
        Done my fair share of
        MOUNTAIN CLIMBING (Mountain Climbing)
        Whoa! Troubles I've got 'em
        MOUNTAIN CLIMBING (Mountain Climbing)
        Whoa! Blues at the bottom
        MOUNTAIN CLIMBING (Mountain Climbing)
        Whoa! Its troubles I've got 'em
        MOUNTAIN CLIMBING (Mountain Climbing)
        Whoa! It's blues at the bottom
