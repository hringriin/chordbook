    \beginverse
        When there's lightning
        You know it always brings me down
        'cause it's free
        And I see that it's me
        Who's lost and never found

        I cry out for magic
        I feel it dancing in the light
        It was cold
        Lost my hold to the shadows of the night
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        No sign of the morning coming
        You've been left on your own
        Like a rainbow in the dark
        A rainbow in the dark
    \endchorus

    \beginverse
        Do your demons
        Do they ever let you go?
        When you've tried
        Do they hide deep inside?
        Is it someone that you know?

        You're just a picture
        You're an image caught in time
        We're a lie
        You and I
        We're words without a rhyme
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        There's no sign of the morning coming
        You've been left on your own
        Like a rainbow in the dark
        Just a rainbow in the dark
    \endchorus

    \beginverse
        When I see lightning
        You know it always brings me down
        'cause it's free
        And I see that it's me
        Who's lost and never found

        Feel the magic
        I fell it floating in the air
        But it's fear
        And you'll hear it calling you beware
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        There's no sign of the morning coming
        There's no sign of the day
        You've been left on your own
        Like a rainbow
        Like a rainbow in the dark
        You're a rainbow in the dark
        Just a rainbow in the dark
    \endchorus
