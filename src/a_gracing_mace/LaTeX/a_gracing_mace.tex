    \label{a_gracing_mace}

    \beginverse\memorize[verse]
        A grazing mace, how sweet the sound, that felled my foe for me
        I bashed his head, he struck the ground, and thus came victory
    \endverse

    \beginverse\memorize[verse]
        My mace has taught my foes to fear, that mace my fear relieved
        How precious did my mace appear, when I my mace received
    \endverse

    \beginverse\memorize[verse]
        Through many tourneys wars and fairs, I have already come
        My mace has brought me safe thus far, my mace will bring me home
    \endverse

    \beginverse\memorize[verse]
        The King has promised good to me, his word my hope secures
        I will his shield and weapon be, when he gives me my spurs
    \endverse

    \beginverse\memorize[verse]
        And when my mace my foeman nails, that mortal strife shall cease
        And we'll possess within our pale, a life of joy and peace
    \endverse

    \beginverse\memorize[verse]
        A grazing mace, how sweet the sound that flattened a wretch like thee!
        Whose head is flat, that once was round; done in by my mace....and me!
    \endverse

    \beginverse\memorize[verse]
        A grazing mace, how sweet the sound that smites a foe like thee
        You're left there lying on the ground, you've left the field to me!
    \endverse
