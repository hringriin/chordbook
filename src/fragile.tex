    \beginverse
        If blood will flow when flesh and stell are one
        Drying in the colour of the evening sun.

        Tomorrow's rain will wash the stains away,
        But something in our minds will always stay.

        Perhaps this final act was meant to clinch a lifetime's argument
        That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could.

        For all those born beneath an angry star
        Lest we forget how fragile we are.
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        On and on the rain will fall
        Like tears from a star, like tears from a star.

        On and on the rain will say
        How fragile we are, how fragile we are
    \endchorus

    \beginchorus
        On and on the rain will fall
        Like tears from a star, like tears from a star.

        On and on the rain will say
        How fragile we are, how fragile we are. \rep{2}
