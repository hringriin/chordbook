    \beginverse\memorize[verse]
        Dashing thru the town, Our firebrands burning bright,
        Striking foemen down, Setting things alight,
        Swords on axes ring, Making spirits bright,
        What fun it is to laugh and sing, A \textbf{slaying} song tonight!
    \endverse

    \beginchorus\memorize[chorus]
        We're viking men, viking men, plundering your shore,
        Another dragon ship sails in discharging twenty more, We're viking men,
        viking men, our axes red with gore,
        Shouting out our battle cries and singing praise to Thor!
    \endchorus

    \beginverse\replay[verse]
        See your harbor fair, Filled with our dragon ships,
        See men with flame-red hair, And foam on bearded lips,
        We come at break of day, To depredate your land,
        And then, when we have gone away, No unburnt building stands.
    \endverse

    \beginchorus\replay[chorus]
        \textnote{Second line is ``Another [...] discharging forty more.''}
        We're viking men, viking men, plundering your shore,
        Another dragon ship sails in discharging twenty more, We're viking men,
        viking men, our axes red with gore,
        Shouting out our battle cries and singing praise to Thor!
    \endchorus

    \beginverse\replay[verse]
        We're carrying away, Whatever we admire,
        Your forces to delay, We've set the rest on fire.
        With you we've had our will, And varied was your cost,
        We sacked the convent on the hill, And more than gold was lost!
    \endverse

    \beginchorus\replay[chorus]
        \textnote{Second line is ``Another [...] discharging eighty more.''}
        We're viking men, viking men, plundering your shore,
        Another dragon ship sails in discharging twenty more, We're viking men,
        viking men, our axes red with gore,
        Shouting out our battle cries and singing praise to Thor!
    \endchorus

    \beginverse\replay[verse]
        There is one simple way, To keep us from your shore,
        If you'll but Danegeld pay,
        \textnote{Sung as insincerely as possible}
        We'll be your \textit{friends} once more.
        his act you will not rue, You'll have no cause to fear,
        \textnote{(Pause a beat or two for effect, the sing \textbf{loudly} \ldots}
        Until the next installment's due, When we come back next year!
    \endverse

        \textnote{Second line is ``A \textbf{fleet} of dragon ships sail in discharging \textbf{thousands} more!''}
        We're viking men, viking men, plundering your shore,
        Another dragon ship sails in discharging twenty more, We're viking men,
        viking men, our axes red with gore,
        Shouting out our battle cries and singing praise to Thor!
