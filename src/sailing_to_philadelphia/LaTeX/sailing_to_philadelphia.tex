    \beginverse*
        \textnote{Intro}
    \endverse

    \beginverse\memorize
        I am Jeremiah Dixon, I am a Geordie Boy
        A glass of wine with you, sir and the ladies I'll enjoy
        All Durham and Northumberland is measured up by my own hand
        It was my fate from birth, to make my mark upon the earth
    \endverse

    \beginverse
        He calls me Charlie Mason, a stargazer am I
        It seems that I was born to chart the evening sky
        They'd cut me out for baking bread, but I had other dreams instead.
        This baker's boy from the west country would join Royal Society
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        We are sailing to Philadelphia
        A world away from the coaly Tyne
        Sailing to Philadelphia
        To draw the line
        A Mason-Dixon line
    \endchorus

    \beginverse*
        \textnote{Intro}
    \endverse

    \beginverse
        Now you're a good surveyor, Dixon, but I'll swear you make me mad.
        The West will kill us both you gullible Geordie lad
        You talk of liberty, how can America be free
        A Geordie and a Baker's boy in the forests of the Iroquois
    \endverse

    \beginverse
        Now hold your head up, Mason, see, America lies there.
        The morning tide has raised the capes of Delaware.
        Come up and feel the sun, a new morning has begun.
        Another day will make it clear, why your stars should guide us here.
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        We are sailing to Philadelphia
        A world away from the coaly Tyne
        Sailing to Philadelphia
        To draw the line
        A Mason-Dixon line
        A Mason-Dixon line
    \endchorus
