    \beginverse*
        Strawberries Cherries And An Angel's Kiss In Spring
        My Summer Wine Is Really Made From All These Things
    \endverse

    \beginverse\memorize[verse]
        I Walked In Town On Silver Spurs That Jingled To
        A Song That I Had Only Sang To Just A Few
        She Saw My Silver Spurs And Said Let's Pass Some Time
        And I Will Give To You Summer Wine
        Ohh-Oh-Oh Summer Wine
    \endverse

    \beginchorus\memorize[chorus]
        Strawberries Cherries And An Angel's Kiss In Spring
        My Summer Wine Is Really Made From All These Things
        Take Off Your Silver Spurs And Help Me Pass The Time
        And I Will Give To You Summer Wine
        Ohh-Oh-Oh Summer Wine
    \endchorus

    \beginverse\replay[verse]
        My Eyes Grew Heavy And My Lips They Could Not Speak
        I Tried To Get Up But I Couldn't Find My Feet
        She Reassured Me With An Unfamiliar Line
        And Then She Gave To Me More Summer Wine
        Ohh-Oh-Oh Summer Wine
    \endverse

    \beginverse\replay[verse]
        When I Woke Up The Sun Was Shining In My Eyes
        My Silver Spurs Were Gone My Head Felt Twice It's Size
        She Took My Silver Spurs A Dollar And A Dime
        And Left Me Cravin' For More Summer Wine
        Ohh-Oh-Oh Summer Wine
