    \beginchorus
        You can run on for a long time
        Run on for a long time
        Run on for a long time
        Sooner or later God'll cut you down
        Sooner or later God'll cut you down
    \endchorus

    \beginverse*
        Go tell that long tongue liar
        Go and tell that midnight rider
        Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter
        Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down
        Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        You can run on for a long time

        Sooner or later God'll cut you down
    \endchorus

    \beginverse
        Well my goodness gracious let me tell you the news
        My head's been wet with the midnight dew
        I've been down on bended knee talkin' to the man from Galilee
        He spoke to me in the voice so sweet
        I thought I heard the shuffle of the angel's feet
        He called my name and my heart stood still
        When he said, "John go do My will!"
    \endverse

    \beginverse*
        Go tell that long tongue liar
        Go and tell that midnight rider
        Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter
        Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down
        Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        You can run on for a long time
        Run on for a long time
        Run on for a long time
        Sooner or later God'll cut you down
        Sooner or later God'll cut you down
    \endchorus

    \beginverse
        Well you may throw your rock and hide your hand
        Workin' in the dark against your fellow man
        But as sure as God made black and white
        What's down in the dark will be brought to the light
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        You can run on for a long time
        Run on for a long time
        Run on for a long time
        Sooner or later God'll cut you down
    \endchorus

    \beginchorus
        You can run on for a long time
        Run on for a long time
        Run on for a long time

        Tell 'em that God's gonna cut you down
        Tell 'em that God's gonna cut you down
