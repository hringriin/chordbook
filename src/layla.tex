    \beginverse
        What will you do when you get lonely
        And nobody's waiting by your side?
        You've been running and hiding much too long
        You know, it's just your foolish pride
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        Layla, you got me on my knees
        Layla, I'm begging darling, please
        Layla, darling, won't you ease my worried mind?
    \endchorus

    \beginverse
        I tried to give you consolation
        When your old man had let you down
        Like a fool, I fell in love with you
        You turned my whole world upside down
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        Layla, you got me on my knees
        Layla, I'm begging darling, please
        Layla, darling, won't you ease my worried mind?
    \endchorus

    \beginverse
        Let's make the best of the situation
        Before I finally go insane
        Please don't say "We'll never find a way"
        And tell me all my love's in vain
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        Layla, you got me on my knees
        Layla, I'm begging darling, please
        Layla, darling, won't you ease my worried mind?
    \endchorus

    \beginchorus
        Layla, you got me on my knees
        Layla, I'm begging darling, please
        Layla, darling, won't you ease my worried mind?
