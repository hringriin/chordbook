    \beginverse
        Cold is the water
        It freezes your already cold mind
        Already cold, cold mind
        And death is at your doorstep
        And it will steal your innocence
        But it will not steal your substance
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        But you are not alone in this
        And you are not alone in this
        As brothers we will stand and we'll hold your hand
        Hold your hand
    \endchorus

    \beginverse
        And you are the mother
        The mother of your baby child
        The one to whom you gave life
        And you have your choices
        And these are what make man great
        His ladder to the stars
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        But you are not alone in this
        And you are not alone in this
        As brothers we will stand and we'll hold your hand
        Hold your hand
    \endchorus

    \beginverse*
        And I will tell the night
        Whisper, ``Lose your sight''
        But I can't move the mountains for you
    \endverse
