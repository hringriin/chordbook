# Chordbook

## About this Repository

This is a collection of texts and chords of various artists, formed to a *Chordbook* mainly with `LaTeX`s [`songs`][songspkg]-Package by *Kevin W. Hamlen*

## Usage

You need `LaTeXe2` installed, this can be achieved e.g. by installing the `texlive` Package under Linux or `MiKTeX` under Windows.

Windows might be a douce about the [`songs`][songspkg] - you propably will have to install it on your own or put the songs.sty into the `Chordbook/Windows` folder.

### Windows

To compile the code it should be sufficient to run the `COMPILE.bat`. For troubleshooting [mail me][mailme].

### Linux

To compile simply type `make` after a directory change into `Chordbook/Linux`
