    \beginverse
        Falling and spinning, losing and winning, keeping my head
        Watching for signals, wearisome vigil,
        Was I misled, I remember you said
        That you don't want to forget me
        It doesn't matter which of our fantasies fled
    \endverse

    \beginverse
        Every tomorrow looking to borrow a piece of today
        Run a bit faster here comes the catcher making his play
        You had better not stay
        You will soon be surrounded
        It doesn't matter which of our fantasies stay
    \endverse

    \beginverse
        Lonely and winsome, calling for someone, living right now
        Something is shallow, ugly and hollow
        Doesn't even allow you to want to know how you might
        Live for the living, and give for the giving
        Moment by moment, one day at a time
        It doesn't matter, it's nothing but dreaming anyhow
    \endverse
