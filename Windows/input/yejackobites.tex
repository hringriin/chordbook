    \beginchorus
        Ye Jacobites by name, lend an ear, lend an ear.
        Ye Jacobites by name, lend an ear.
        Ye Jacobites by name, your faults I will proclaim
        Your doctrines I must blame, you shall hear.
    \endchorus

    \beginverse
        What is right and what is wrong by the law, by the law.
        What is right and what is wrong by the law.
        What is right and what is wrong, by a short sword or by long
        And a weak arm or a strong for to draw.
    \endverse

        Ye Jacobites by name, lend an ear, lend an ear.

        Ye Jacobites by name, your faults I will proclaim
        Your doctrines I must blame, you shall hear.
    \endchorus

    \beginverse
        What makes heroic strife famed afar, famed afar?
        What makes heroic strife famed afar?
        What makes heroic strife, to whet the assassins's knife
        Or hunt a parent's life with bloody war.
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        Ye Jacobites by name, lend an ear, lend an ear.

        Ye Jacobites by name, your faults I will proclaim
        Your doctrines I must blame, you shall hear.
    \endchorus

    \beginverse
        Then leave your schemes alone in the state, in the state.
        Then leave your schemes alone in the state.
        Then leave your schemes alone adore the rising sun
        And leave a man alone to his fate.
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        Ye Jacobites by name, lend an ear, lend an ear
        Ye Jacobites by name, lend an ear.
        Ye Jacobites by name, your faults I will proclaim
        Your doctrines I must blame, you shall hear.
